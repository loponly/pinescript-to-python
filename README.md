**ðŸ”§ Project Scope:**

**Module 1: Pine Script Conversion**
- Convert a library of 26 indicators, including custom-coded scripts and standard indicators with specific configurations
- Must match TradingView calculations exactly

- Support multiple timeframes (5m, 15m, 1h, 1d)
- Custom timeframe support preferred (e.g., 13min, 45min)
- Calculate: Return %, Win Rate, Profit Factor, Max Drawdown
- Commission/slippage settings

**Module 3: Optimization System**
- Test all indicator combinations across 50+ stocks
- System should output: Ticker | Timeframe | Strategy Config | PF | WR | DD
- Efficient parallel processing for speed

**Module 4: Results & Analysis**
- Export results to CSV/Database
- Simple GUI or web dashboard
